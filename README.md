# 100 Days of Python Challenge

Welcome to my **100 Days of Python Challenge**! This repository contains my journey of refreshing and expanding my Python skills, covering both foundational and advanced concepts. Throughout this challenge, I aim to practice Python coding every day, complete small projects, and upload them to GitHub. Each day will focus on improving my knowledge and applying what I learn in practical scenarios.

## üìÖ Challenge Overview

The **100 Days of Python Challenge** involves daily coding practice on various Python topics. These topics include:

- **Python Basics**: Variables, data types, loops, conditionals, functions, and file handling.
- **Advanced Concepts**: Data structures, list comprehensions, error handling, and more.
- **Project Development**: Each day, I will complete small projects or coding challenges and push them to this repository. These will demonstrate my progress and help reinforce my learning.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Skills Learned

Here are the key skills I plan to focus on during the 100 days:

- **Python Syntax & Basics**: Mastery of the fundamentals, including functions, loops, and conditionals.
- **Data Structures**: In-depth understanding of lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples, and more.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **Advanced Python Concepts**: Decorators, generators, lambda functions, and error handling.
- **Data Science**: Using Python for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning basics.
- **File Handling**: Reading and writing to files in various formats (e.g., text files, CSVs).

Each day will have:

- A **Jupyter Notebook** (`.ipynb` file) where the project or code is executed.
- A **README.md** file detailing the project, skills demonstrated, and key learnings.

## üìú Day 1 - Python Basics Refresher

**Project Name**: Python Basics Refresher  
**Skills Demonstrated**: Python syntax, loops, conditional statements, and functions.  
**Learnings**: Reviewed foundational Python concepts and wrote reusable scripts for common programming problems.

### Example Code:
```python
# Example of a basic Python script
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("World"))
```

## üß© How to Contribute

If you're following along with this challenge or want to contribute, feel free to fork this repository and create your own branch for each day. Once you've completed the challenges for the day, you can create a pull request with your changes.

## üñãÔ∏è How to Use This Repository

- **Clone the repository** to your local machine using the following command:
  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/100-days-challenge.git
  ```

- **Navigate** into the folder for the day you're working on and open the corresponding Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb` file).

- You can use **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab** to run the code, practice the exercises, and apply the learned concepts.

## üîÑ Progress Tracking

Throughout the challenge, I will update this repository daily with new projects and exercises. I aim to:

1. **Solve daily coding problems**.
2. **Create mini-projects** based on the day's topic.
3. **Share key learnings** and explanations to reinforce my understanding.

## üì¢ Why I'm Doing This Challenge

I'm doing this challenge as part of my learning journey to:

- **Reignite my passion** for coding and programming.
- **Strengthen my Python skills** for future data science projects.
- **Contribute** to open-source projects and share my knowledge with the community.

## üèÅ Final Thoughts

The **100 Days of Python Challenge** is not just about completing exercises but also about building a consistent learning habit. Each day, I will make progress and upload it here so I can review my work and improve over time. Feel free to check back regularly to see how I'm doing!
